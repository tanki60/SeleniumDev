##This is a personal project to learn Selenium Webdriver 2.0. The goal of this project is to automate a specific Site by
learning and implementing different modules/functionalities of Selenium 2.0 framework. It is a work in-progress.##

I have started this project on my own, with the help of online materials, and surely Google! :)

Design Pattern: Page Object Model.
# Selenium 2.53.0
# Firefox 45.0.1 ESR
# Firebug 2.0.19
# Java
# GitHub
# Extent Reports with Dashboard (for custom reports)
# Log4j
#Eclipse IDE

Please also read the 'TestRun-Overview.txt' for details on what each test does.

oh, you can see the 'test-output' and 'custom-report' folders for generic and custom reports (index.html, and custom-report-*.html)- don't judge just yet! haha.


Next on Selenium: Docker container for nodes to use Selenium Grid.
